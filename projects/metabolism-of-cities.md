Urban sustainability platform: including data repositories, maps, visualisations, academic literature, MOOC, and more

- Repo: https://gitlab.com/metabolism-of-cities/metabolism-of-cities-platform
- Trello board: https://trello.com/b/fU7GO8Is/%F0%9F%8C%83-metabolism-of-cities (there is LOTS more to do but this gives some ideas)

## Stack

- Django & PostgreSQL
- Bootstrap for CSS
- Various JS libraries for data viz, e.g. Leaflet and Highcharts

## Help needed:

* Data crunching: writing scripts in the language of your choice to scrape, convert, and prepare data. Writeup from one of our collaborators: https://github.com/anelda/metabolism_cities/blob/master/Hack%20for%20Human%20Rights%20-%20Metabolism%20of%20Cities%20-%20Damlevels-%20UPDATED.ipynb
* Data collection: we are building a volunteer network to collect sustainability data for cities. Lots of this can be found in open data portals, in government reports, annual reports from corporates, etc. It is very scattered and in inconsistent formats. Help bring this into a single place!

* Front-end: we very much need some strengthening here. Look and feel can improve. CSS skills would be much appreciated. Lots of JS work to be done. Leaflet skills will be great, but there are lots of other JS tasks to be done as well.
* Design: we would love to make beautiful designs to showcase material stocks and flows. But we don't have the design skills! Join us to help visualise the environmental footprint of our cities.
* Back-end: anyone with Django/Python skills can help expand and improve our work. Lots to be done there. 
* We are a non-profit with a global core team of members. We are always seeking volunteers to help run the platform and the organisation. If you are interested in joining the team behind this platform, check out our various task forces: https://metabolismofcities.org/about/task-forces
